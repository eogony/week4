# Pig Dice

## Project Description

Javascript application that rolls a virtual dice in randomness. This dice roller allows players to roll a die.  After each roll, the player is faced with two choices: roll again or decline to roll again (hold). 
  1. If the player rolls a 1, the player scores nothing and it becomes the opponent's turn. 
  2. If the player rolls a number other than 1, the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues. 
  3. If the player holds, the turn total, the sum of the rolls during the turn, is added to the player's score, and it becomes the opponent's turn.
